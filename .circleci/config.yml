          # Possible option is to use narrativescience/ghpr orb with get-pr-info, but this step can't be disabled
          # So then we'd only be able to run this job on PRs, and would require separate job for running on main
          # We use alternative approach, in which:
          # 1) If current branch is main - pre-commit checks all files
          # 2) Otherwise - we find common ancestor between current commit and main and run pre-commit with a base (from-ref) set to that ancestor
